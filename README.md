# **Encrypter and Decrypter**
**DEBAYAN MAJUMDER**

This is a **python script** which read a file you pass and then **convert it** to an equivalent **encription**
**algorithm you choose**.
Now, the encription algorithm already comes with builtin modules but here I 
recreated the algorithm for a better programming experience.

- [GOAL OF THE PROJECT](#goal-of-the-project)
- [INPUT](#input)

## GOAL OF THE PROJECT:
- To show how to work with multiple files inside of python.
- How to import packages and built your own inside of python.
- The classic encode and decode algorithms.

## INPUT
- You have to enter the file path when the interpreter asks.
- Choose the encoding/Encrypting algorithm you prefer to use.

**The script will generate a folder named Export and the exported files(with their parent file name) will go under that directory.**

### **To run the script, write in the terminal**
</br>

#### **For Encrypting a data file**
```
python encrypter.py
```
</br>

#### **For Decrypting a data file**
```
python decrypter.py
```
##### **N.B : PLEASE INCLUDE THE WHOLE FILE PATH, ALSO THE NAMES ARE CASE SENSITIVE**
