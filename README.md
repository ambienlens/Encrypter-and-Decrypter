# **Encrypter and Decrypter**
**DEBAYAN MAJUMDER**

This is a **python script** which reads a file you pass and then **converts it** to an equivalent **encryption algorithm you choose**.
The script can also **dencrypt** the message/data you **encrypted before**, but this time the decrypter is **intelligent enough to understand the encrypting algorithm**.
Now, the encryption or decryption algorithm already comes with builtin modules but here I 
**recreated** the algorithm for a **better programming experience**.

- [GOAL OF THE PROJECT](#goal-of-the-project)
- [ENCRYPTION INPUT](#encryption-input)
- [DECRYPTION INPUT](#decryption-input)
- [RUNNING THE CODE](#executing-the-script)

## GOAL OF THE PROJECT:
- To show how to work with multiple files inside of python.
- How to import packages and built your own inside of python.
- The classic encode and decode algorithms.
- How to make hidden files, also how to edit some hidden files
- Make new Directories/Files
- User Friendly scripts

## **ENCRYPTION INPUT**
- You have to enter the file path when the interpreter asks.
- Choose the encoding/Encrypting algorithm you prefer to use.

**The script will generate a folder named "Export" and the exported files(with their parent file name) will go under that directory.**

</br>

## **DECRYPTION INPUT**
- You have to enter the file path when the interpreter asks you to.

**The script will Export the decrypted data file in a folder named "Export" and the exported files(with their parent file name) will go under that directory**

</br>

## **EXECUTING THE SCRIPT**
### **To run the script, write in the Terminal/Shell**
</br>

#### **For Encrypting a data file**
```
python encrypter.py
```
</br>

#### **For Decrypting a data file**
```
python decrypter.py
```
##### **N.B : PLEASE INCLUDE THE WHOLE FILE PATH, ALSO THE NAMES ARE CASE SENSITIVE**
